Household power consumption


 
 Household Power Consumption Prediction
 
 
 Project Overview:
            
            In today’s world, efficient energy management is essential for both households and utility providers. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that accurately predicts household power consumption using historical energy usage data. The goal is to derive actionable insights and optimize electricity consumption to reduce costs, detect anomalies, and support sustainability.

 Problem Statement:
 
       The objective is to develop a regression-based model that forecasts energy consumption, helping:
         
       Households reduce bills and understand usage patterns.

       Energy providers manage load and forecast demand more effectively.

       Environmental efforts by minimizing wastage and promoting green energy habits.

 Business Use Cases:
       Energy Management for Households

       Demand Forecasting for Providers

       Anomaly Detection

      Smart Grid Optimization

      Environmental Impact Monitoring
